# K.JURKOWSKA_PORTFOLIO


## About me


My name is Katarzyna Jurkowska. I graduated from the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice. I hold an Msc degree in Chemical Engineering.
I have over 10 years of work experience (as a Document Controller, Cost Controller, Data Analyst). Willingness to learn and striving for greater use of analytical skills caused that I am currently seeking to change my profession and start working in the IT industry, in the field of testing and Quality Assurance. 

Currently, I am working in the company which is implementing new systems (ERP, e-commerce). I participate in the process of creating a concept/analysis and aligning project requirements in cooperation with two development teams. Therefore, I am currently preparing migration files with product data and checking the correctness of the migrated data in the stage/testing environment from the Client's side.

As a tester I could make use of my skills such as accuracy, patience and attention to detail which are also related to my current job. Additionally, I am communicative and I will easily cooperate with a new team.
